    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I first got into the likes of coding at the age of 11
            when  my step dad introduced me to a game called <a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Borderlands">Borderlands</a>.
            Borderlands is a first person shooter game in the distant future, 
            where several colonization ships head to a planet on the edge of the galaxy called 
            Pandora.  The colonists are drawn there in search of a better life as well as vast mineral resources that are said to be on the planet, free for the taking.
            Being only 8 my mind instantly went into a pool of
            of curiosity about the game. I was inntrigued and motivated. That being said my feelings eventually led me to 
            completing the game only to find out there was more to it. I found out that there was a software
            desgined to modify the game called <a href="https://borderlands.fandom.com/wiki/Willowtree">WillowTree</a>. WillowTree is a software utility used to modify Borderlands save games.
